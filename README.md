# Shortiu Erel

This is a simple application built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) and a little of [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) to shorten URLs. I built this to improve my skills on those technologies, so this is a personal project.

## Installation

1) Clone this repository into your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OCarvajalMora/Shortiu-Erel.git
```

2) Then, you have to install all the project dependencies git NPM running this commands:
```bash
cd shortiu-erel # change directory to the project folder
npm i # install all the dependencies with NPM
```

3) Now, you should duplicate **.env.example** file and rename the copy to **.env**
4) Finally, you have to set your MONGO_URI variable on **.env** file.


## Usage

1. First, you have to check if you machine is running Mongo.
2. You should run the application with this command (into project folder):

```bash
npm run serve # this will run the application into a local host (e.g. http://localhost:3000)
```
3. Open the URL with your navigator.
